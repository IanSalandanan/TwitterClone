- Our inspiration for the design of our website is that a social media to be a happy and relaxing place, where in we called it as an "Oasis" where the design concept is a relaxing monochrome style.

- The approach that we did for our website is a multi-page html, and a simplistic approach.

- We made our website creative by exploring themes and designs that are appealing, yet pleasing to the eyes while having a
  smooth experience. We used the "glass morphism" theme, showcasing translucent and window like elements to create a sense
  of depth and realism, mimicking the appearance of an acrylic or frosted glass. With this, this showcases an appealing visual
  aesthetic, engaging user experience, and incorporating modern trends.

### How we worked as a team to accomplish the project?

- Our project was divided in three sections, which are the Log In & Registration, Timeline, Profile & Following. These sections are the ones that gave us a role on which to make in our website. As we work on the tasks, we made sure to help each other for a better outcome and collaboration.

- Through a great communication, we easily prevented conflicts in changes of codes with each other. We kept each other updated for every push or changes that we did on our codes, no matter how big or small the changes are. By using a multi-page html, this also prevented us from having code changes conflicts.

### How could we improve our website in the future?

- We could improve our website even more by learning the advanced syntaxs of JavaScript, as we had quite some trouble in using the APIs. Overall, a few more practice and knowledge would definitely help us in improving our future works.
