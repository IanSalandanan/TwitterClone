###How we worked as a team to accomplish the project?
Our project was divided in three sections, which are the Log In & Registration, Timeline, Profile & Following. These sections are the ones that gave us a role on which to make in our website. As we work on the tasks, we made sure to help each other for a better outcome and collaboration.

Through a great communication, we easily prevented conflicts in changes of codes with each other. We kept each other updated for every push or changes that we did on our codes, no matter how big or small the changes are.
